  Run MATLAB scripts, functions, and statements. When you use this command, all of the required
  files must be on the MATLAB search path.

parameters:
  command:
    description: >
      Script, function, or statement to execute. If the value of `command` is the name of a MATLAB
      script or function, do not specify the file extension. If you specify more than one script,
      function, or statement, use a comma or semicolon to separate them. MATLAB exits with exit
      code 0 if the specified script, function, or statement executes successfully without error.
      Otherwise, MATLAB terminates with a nonzero exit code, which causes the command to fail.
      To fail the command in certain conditions, use the `assert` or `error` function.

  startup-options:
    description: >
      MATLAB startup options, specified as a list of options separated by spaces. For more
      information about startup options, see

    type: string
    default: ""
  no-output-timeout:
    description: >
      Elapsed time the command can run without output. The string is a decimal with unit suffix,
      such as “20m”, “1.25h”, “5s”. The default is 10 minutes and the maximum is governed by the
      maximum time a job is allowed to run.

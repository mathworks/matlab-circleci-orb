parameters:
  products:
    description: >
      Products to install in addition to MATLAB, specified as a list of product names separated by
      spaces. You can specify this parameter to install most MathWorks products and support packages. The
      command uses MATLAB Package Manager (`mpm`) to install products. For a list of supported
      products and their correctly formatted names, see
      https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/MPM.md#product-installation-options.
    type: string
    default: ''
  release:
    description: >
      MATLAB release to install. You can specify R2021a or a later release. By default, the value of `release`
      is `latest`. If you do not specify `release`, the command installs the latest release of MATLAB.
    type: string
    default: 'latest'
  no-output-timeout:
    description: >
      Elapsed time the command can run without output. The string is a decimal with unit suffix,

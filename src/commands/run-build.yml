  Run builds using the MATLAB build tool. Use this command to run the tasks in the plan returned
  by a file named buildfile.m in the root of your repository. To use the run-build command, you
  need MATLAB R2022b or a later release.

parameters:
  tasks:
    description: >
      Space-separated list of tasks to run. If not specified, the command runs the default tasks
      in the plan returned by buildfile.m as well as all the tasks on which they depend.
    type: string
    default: ""
  build-options:
    description: >
      MATLAB build options, specified as a list of options separated by spaces. The command
      supports the same options that you can pass to the `buildtool` command when running a
      MATLAB build. For more information, see
      https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/buildtool.html.
    type: string
    default: ""
  startup-options:
    description: >
      MATLAB startup options. If you specify more than one option, use a space to
      separate the options.
    type: string
    default: ""
  no-output-timeout:
    description: >
      Elapsed time the command can run without output. The string is a decimal with unit suffix,
      such as “20m”, “1.25h”, “5s”. The default is 10 minutes and the maximum is governed by the
      maximum time a job is allowed to run.
    type: string
    default: 10m

description: >
  Run a build using the MATLAB build tool. Use this command to run the tasks specified in a file
  named `buildfile.m` in the root of your repository. To use the run-build command, you need MATLAB
  R2022b or a later release. MATLAB exits with exit code 0 if the tasks run without error. Otherwise,
  MATLAB terminates with a nonzero exit code, which causes the command to fail. The command uses the
  topmost MATLAB version on the system path.

parameters:
  tasks:
    description: >
      Tasks to run, specified as a list of task names separated by spaces. If a task accepts arguments,
      enclose them in parentheses. If you do not specify `tasks`, the command runs the default tasks in
      `buildfile.m` as well as all the tasks on which they depend.
    type: string
    default: ""
  build-options:
    description: >
      MATLAB build options, specified as a list of options separated by spaces. The command
      supports the same options that you can pass to the `buildtool` command when running a
      MATLAB build. For more information, see
      https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/buildtool.html.
    type: string
    default: ""
  startup-options:
    description: >
      MATLAB startup options, specified as a list of options separated by spaces. For more
      information about startup options, see
      https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/commonly-used-startup-options.html.
    type: string
    default: ""
  no-output-timeout:
    description: >
      Elapsed time the command can run without output. The string is a decimal with unit suffix,
      such as “20m”, “1.25h”, “5s”. The default is 10 minutes and the maximum is governed by the
      maximum time a job is allowed to run.
    type: string
    default: 10m
